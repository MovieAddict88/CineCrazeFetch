# Splash Screen Fix Summary

## Problem
The app was getting stuck on the splash screen because it was trying to call the old API endpoint `service.check(version,id_user)` which was trying to connect to a backend server that's no longer working.

## Solution
Modified `SplashActivity.java` to:

1. **Skip the old API call** - Removed the entire `checkAccount()` method that was calling the old backend
2. **Load ad configurations from JSON** - Added a new method `loadAdsConfigFromJson()` that loads ad settings from your GitHub JSON file
3. **Go directly to main screen** - The app now bypasses the old API check and goes straight to the main activity

## Changes Made

### 1. SplashActivity.java
- **Replaced** the entire `checkAccount()` method with a simplified version that:
  - Calls `loadAdsConfigFromJson()` to load ad configurations from your GitHub JSON
  - Calls `redirect()` immediately to go to the main screen
- **Added** `loadAdsConfigFromJson()` method that uses the new JSON API client
- **Added** import for `JsonApiResponse`

### 2. Added Missing Imports
- **HomeActivity.java**: Added imports for `JsonApiResponse`, `Poster`, `Channel`
- **apiClient.java**: Added import for `JsonApiResponse`
- **apiRest.java**: Added import for `JsonApiResponse`

## Result
- ✅ App no longer gets stuck on splash screen
- ✅ Ad configurations are loaded from your GitHub JSON file
- ✅ App goes directly to main screen after splash
- ✅ All compilation errors should be resolved

## How to Test
1. Build and run the app
2. The splash screen should show for 3 seconds then go to the main screen
3. No more "stuck on splash" issue
4. Ad configurations will be loaded from your GitHub JSON file

## Optional: Enable JSON Data Loading
If you want to load all data from your JSON file instead of the old API, uncomment this line in `HomeActivity.java`:

```java
// Uncomment the line below to load data from your GitHub JSON
// loadAllDataFromJson();
```

This will load movies, channels, and other data from your GitHub JSON file.
