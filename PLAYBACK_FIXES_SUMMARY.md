# Video Playback Crash Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Intent Parameters
**Problem**: The app was crashing because the `isLive` boolean parameter was missing from Intent extras when launching PlayerActivity.

**Fixed in**:
- `MovieActivity.java` - Added `intent.putExtra("isLive",false);` 
- `SerieActivity.java` - Added `intent.putExtra("isLive",false);` for both movie and trailer playback
- `DownloadsFragment.java` - Added `intent.putExtra("isLive",false);` for both WiFi and local playback
- Added missing `id`, `kind`, and `subtitle` parameters where needed

### 2. ExoPlayer Version Compatibility Issues
**Problem**: Using outdated ExoPlayer 2.10.8 with deprecated APIs and SimpleExoPlayerView.

**Fixed**:
- Updated ExoPlayer version from 2.10.8 to 2.18.7 in `build.gradle`
- Added ExoPlayer HLS module for better M3U8 support
- Replaced deprecated `ExoPlayerFactory.newSimpleInstance()` with `SimpleExoPlayer.Builder()`
- Updated layout XML to use `PlayerView` instead of deprecated `SimpleExoPlayerView`

### 3. Missing Video Format Support
**Problem**: MKV and MPD formats were not properly handled, causing crashes.

**Fixed**:
- Added MKV support alongside MP4 in progressive media source creation
- Added MPD support alongside DASH format
- Added proper error handling with fallback to progressive source
- Added try-catch blocks around media source creation

### 4. Null Pointer Exceptions
**Problem**: Multiple potential NPEs in player initialization and playback controls.

**Fixed**:
- Added null checks in PlayerActivity.onCreate() for intent extras
- Added proper validation for video URL before player initialization
- Added null checks in CustomPlayerFragment lifecycle methods
- Added null checks in seek operations (forward/backward buttons)
- Added proper null checks in Cast session event handlers

### 5. Subtitle Handling Issues
**Problem**: Subtitle creation could cause crashes with malformed URLs or unsupported formats.

**Fixed**:
- Added validation for subtitle URL and type before creating subtitle source
- Updated subtitle source creation to use proper Factory pattern
- Added try-catch blocks around subtitle source creation
- Fixed subtitle format handling for SRT, VTT, and ASS files

### 6. Player Cleanup and Memory Leaks
**Problem**: ExoPlayer instances were not properly released, causing memory leaks and potential crashes.

**Fixed**:
- Added proper `release()` method in CustomPlayerViewModel
- Added `onDestroy()` method in CustomPlayerFragment to release player
- Added listener removal before player release
- Added try-catch blocks around player cleanup operations

### 7. Error Handling
**Problem**: No proper error handling for ExoPlayer errors, causing silent crashes.

**Fixed**:
- Implemented comprehensive `onPlayerError()` method with different error type handling
- Added logging for all error scenarios
- Added fallback mechanisms for failed media source creation
- Added activity finish() calls for unrecoverable errors

## Video Format Support Added

The app now properly supports:
- **MP4** - Progressive media source
- **MKV** - Progressive media source (same as MP4)
- **M3U8/HLS** - HLS media source with improved handling
- **MPD/DASH** - DASH media source with proper factory pattern

## Key Technical Changes

1. **Intent Parameters**: All video entry clicks now pass complete parameter sets including `isLive`, `id`, `kind`, and `subtitle`
2. **ExoPlayer API**: Updated to modern ExoPlayer 2.18.7 with Builder pattern
3. **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks and null checks throughout the playback chain
4. **Memory Management**: Proper player lifecycle management and resource cleanup
5. **Format Detection**: Robust media source creation with fallback mechanisms

## Testing Recommendations

After applying these fixes:
1. Test video playback from movie listings
2. Test video playback from series episodes 
3. Test live channel playback
4. Test downloaded video playback
5. Test trailer playback
6. Test all supported video formats (MP4, MKV, M3U8, MPD)
7. Test subtitle functionality
8. Test Cast functionality
9. Test seek operations (forward/backward)
10. Test orientation changes during playback

The app should now handle video entry clicks without crashing and provide stable playback for all supported video formats.
